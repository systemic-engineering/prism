# Terni-Functor

For the mathematically curious. Not required reading — you can use `.eh()` productively without any of this.

## What it is

A terni-functor is a three-state composition that carries a monoidal annotation through the middle state. `Imperfect<T, E, L>` is one:

- **Success(T)** — pure value, zero annotation
- **Partial(T, L)** — value with annotation
- **Failure(E)** — no value

The bind operator (`.eh()`) composes these while accumulating the annotation via the `Loss` monoid.

## Relation to bifunctors

`Result<T, E>` is a bifunctor — it has two type parameters that can be mapped independently (`map` for `T`, `map_err` for `E`). `Imperfect` extends this to three parameters. It's a trifunctor in the same sense: `map` for `T`, `map_err` for `E`, and the `Loss` parameter is accumulated rather than mapped.

The key difference: `Result` is a coproduct (either/or). `Imperfect` has a middle state that carries both a value *and* metadata about that value. This middle state is where the interesting composition happens.

## Relation to Writer

Haskell's `Writer w a` carries a monoidal log alongside a value. `Partial(T, L)` looks similar — value plus monoid. But `Writer` always carries the log. `Imperfect` has three states:

- `Success` carries no log (it's structurally absent, not zero)
- `Partial` carries the log
- `Failure` has no value to log against

This is not `Writer`. `Writer` is `(a, w)`. `Imperfect` is `Success a | Partial a w | Failure e`. The failure path and the "genuinely zero loss" path both exist as distinct states, not as special values of the monoid.

## The monad laws

For `.eh()` to be a genuine bind, it must satisfy three laws:

### Left identity

`return a >>= f  ==  f a`

```rust
use terni::{Imperfect, ConvergenceLoss};

fn f(x: i32) -> Imperfect<i32, String, ConvergenceLoss> {
    Imperfect::Partial(x * 2, ConvergenceLoss::new(1))
}

let left = Imperfect::<i32, String, ConvergenceLoss>::Success(5).eh(f);
let right = f(5);

assert_eq!(left, right);
```

`Success` is `return`. Binding `Success(a)` through `f` gives exactly `f(a)`.

### Right identity

`m >>= return  ==  m`

```rust
use terni::{Imperfect, ConvergenceLoss};

let m = Imperfect::<i32, String, ConvergenceLoss>::Partial(5, ConvergenceLoss::new(3));

let result = m.clone().eh(|x| Imperfect::Success(x));

assert_eq!(result, m);
```

Binding through `Success` (return) preserves the original value and loss.

### Associativity

`(m >>= f) >>= g  ==  m >>= (|x| f(x) >>= g)`

```rust
use terni::{Imperfect, ConvergenceLoss};

fn f(x: i32) -> Imperfect<i32, String, ConvergenceLoss> {
    Imperfect::Partial(x + 1, ConvergenceLoss::new(2))
}

fn g(x: i32) -> Imperfect<i32, String, ConvergenceLoss> {
    Imperfect::Partial(x * 2, ConvergenceLoss::new(3))
}

let m = Imperfect::<i32, String, ConvergenceLoss>::Partial(1, ConvergenceLoss::new(1));

let left = m.clone().eh(f).eh(g);
let right = m.eh(|x| f(x).eh(g));

assert_eq!(left, right);
```

The order of binding doesn't matter. Loss accumulation is associative because `Loss::combine` is associative.

## Why this works

The monad laws hold because:

1. `Success` acts as a genuine unit — no loss to combine, value passes through.
2. `Failure` acts as a zero — short-circuits, `f` never called.
3. `Partial`'s loss accumulation delegates to `Loss::combine`, which is required to be associative.

The `Loss` monoid does the heavy lifting. Any associative `combine` with an identity `zero` gives you a lawful bind for free. The three-state structure just adds the failure short-circuit that `Writer` lacks.

## Why this has no precedent

Every mainstream language handles errors in two states: success or failure. Some languages carry metadata (Java's checked exceptions carry types, Go returns `(T, error)` tuples), but none reify the middle state as a first-class composition target.

`Either`/`Result` is the closest: two states, one bind operator. Haskell's `Writer` carries metadata but has no failure state. `ExceptT (WriterT ...)` monad transformer stacks come close, but they compose loss even through the success path — there's no "genuinely lossless" state distinct from "zero loss."

`Imperfect` is the first type (that we know of) to combine all three: success, annotated success, and failure in a single bind operator with lawful monad composition.

The design came from tabletop games, not category theory. PbtA's three-tier outcome structure (full success / success with cost / failure) was the insight. The math just confirmed it was sound.
